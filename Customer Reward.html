    <h2>A <u>CUSTOMER REWARD PROGRAM</u> is a marketing strategy used by tour agencies to encourage customer loyalty and repeat business. These programs are designed to incentivize customers to continue booking their travel services with the same agency.
    <br>The rewards can come in various forms, such as discounts, upgrades, or exclusive access to events or experiences. For example, a customer who books multiple trips with the same agency may receive a discount on their next booking, or they may be upgraded to a better room or seating class on their next flight.
    <br>The program can also offer exclusive benefits to its members, such as access to special promotions or early bird booking opportunities. Members may also receive personalized recommendations based on their travel history and preferences.
    <br>Overall, customer reward programs are a win-win for both the tour agency and its customers. The agency benefits from increased customer loyalty and repeat business, while customers enjoy the perks and benefits of being a loyal customer.
    <br>There are several reasons why a customer reward program can be beneficial for a tour agency:
    <br><b><u>Loyalty</b></u>: A customer reward program can increase customer loyalty by incentivizing customers to continue booking with the same tour agency in order to earn rewards.
    <br><b><u>Repeat business</b></u>: By encouraging customers to book with the same agency multiple times, a reward program can increase repeat business and help to establish long-term relationships with customers.
    <br><b><u>Increased revenue</b></u>: Customers who participate in a reward program may be more likely to spend more money in order to earn rewards, leading to increased revenue for the tour agency.
    <br><b><u>Positive word-of-mouth</b></u>: Customers who have a positive experience with a tour agency's reward program are likely to share their experience with friends and family, which can lead to positive word-of-mouth and new customers.
    <br>Overall, a customer reward program can be an effective way to retain existing customers and encourage repeat business, while also generating positive buzz and increasing revenue for the tour agency</h2>
